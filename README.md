# Hispathologic Cancer Detection
## Identifing metastatic tissue in histopathologic scans of lymph node sections

Lymph node metastases occur in most cancer types (e.g. breast, prostate, colon). Lymph nodes are small glands that filter lymph, the fluid that circulates through the lymphatic system. The lymph nodes in the underarms are the first place breast cancer is likely to spread. Metastatic involvement of lymph nodes is one of the most important prognostic variables in breast cancer. The diagnostic procedure for pathologists is, however, tedious and time-consuming and prone to misinterpretation. 

Automated detection of lymph node metastasis has a great potential to help the pathologist. Within the past few years, the field has been moving towards a fully automated analysis of whole-slide images to detect cancer, to predict prognosis or identify metastases.
